<h1>Project title : Churn Prediction for E-Commerce Customers</h1>

<h2>Project Overview :</h2>
<p align = 'justify'>
As a data science team, our goal is to predict customer churn in an e-commerce setting and provide recommendations to enhance engagement and reduce the churn rate. Customer churn is a major challenge in the e-commerce industry and can have a significant impact on the company's revenue. By using machine learning techniques, we aim to identify the factors that contribute to customer churn and develop a model to accurately predict which customers are likely to churn.
</p>
<h2>Role :</h2>
<p align = 'justify'>
We will be analyzing customer data from the e-commerce platform, including demographic information, customer behavior, and other relevant features. Our goal is to find the key drivers of customer churn and develop a predictive model that takes these factors into account.
</p>
<h2>Metrics :</h2>
<p align = 'justify'>
To evaluate the success of our model, we will be using two key metrics: customer churn rate and customer satisfaction score. The churn rate will indicate the percentage of customers who have stopped using the platform, while the satisfaction score will reflect the level of customer satisfaction with the platform. By reducing the churn rate and improving the satisfaction score, we aim to increase customer retention and ultimately drive growth for the e-commerce platform.
</p>
<h2>Outcome :</h2>
<p align = 'justify'>
The outcome of this project will be a machine learning model that can accurately predict customer churn and provide recommendations for enhancing customer engagement. The model will be validated using the metrics of customer churn rate and customer satisfaction score, and its results will be used to inform decisions and strategies aimed at reducing customer churn and improving customer satisfaction. By using data-driven insights, we aim to help the e-commerce platform improve its customer retention and drive growth for the business.

<h2>Exploratory Data Analysis</h2>
<p align = 'justify'>
<ul>Statistic Descriptive
    <li>The data has 20 columns.</li>
    <li>There are three columns with inappropriate data types, namely Churn, CityTier and Complain.</li>
    <li>Some variations of the column contents appear to be duplicated, using different values for the same purpose.</li>
    <li>There is a different number of data counts indicating a missing value in columns such as Tenure, WarehouseToHome, HourSpendOnApp, OrderAmountHikeFromlastYear, CouponUsed, OrderCount, DaySinceLastOrder and CashbackAmount. </li>
    <li>There is a suspicious value in the WarehouseToHome column with a max value of 127 with an average value of 15.64. NumberOfAddress with a Max value of 22 (this value is too large) with an average of 4. </li>
    <li>However, there is no data that has a suspicious distance between the mean and median.</li>
